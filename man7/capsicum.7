.TH CAPSICUM 7 2014-05-07 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
capsicum \- lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/capsicum.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework implementing a hybrid
capability system model.
Capsicum can be used for application and library compartmentalisation, the
decomposition of larger bodies of software into isolated (sandboxed)
components in order to implement security policies and limit the impact of
software vulnerabilities.
.PP
Capsicum provides three core kernel mechanisms,
.IR "Capsicum capabilities",
.I "capability mode"
and
.IR "process descriptors",
each described below.

.SS Capsicum Capabilities
A
.I Capsicum capability
is a file descriptor that has been limited so that only
certain operations can be performed on it.
For example, a file descriptor returned by
.BR open (2)
may be refined using
.BR cap_rights_limit (2)
so that only
.BR read (2)
and
.BR write (2)
can be called on it, but not
.BR fchmod (2).
The complete list of the capability rights can be found in the
.BR rights (7)
manual page.

.SS Capability Mode
Capsicum capability mode is a process mode, entered by invoking
.BR cap_enter (3),
in which access to global OS namespaces (such as the file system and PID
namespaces) is restricted; only explicitly delegated rights, referenced by
memory mappings or file descriptors, may be used.
Once set, the flag is inherited by future children processes, and may not be
cleared.

.SS Process Descriptors
.I Process descriptors
are file descriptors representing processes, allowing parent processes to manage
child processes without requiring access to the PID namespace, and are described in
greater detail in
.BR pdfork (2).
.SH VERSIONS
Capsicum support is available in the kernel since version 3.???.
