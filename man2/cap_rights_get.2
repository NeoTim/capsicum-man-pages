.TH CAP_RIGHTS_GET 2 2014-05-07 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
cap_rights_get \- retrieve Capsicum capability rights
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/capsicum.h>
.sp
.BI "int cap_rights_get(int " fd ", struct cap_rights *" rights ,
.BI "                   unsigned int *" fcntls ,
.BI "                   int *" nioctls ", unsigned int *" ioctls );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Obtain the current Capsicum capability rights for a file descriptor.
.PP
The function will fill the
.I rights
argument (if non-NULL) with the primary capability rights of the
.I fd
descriptor.  The result can be examined with the
.BR cap_rights_is_set (3)
family of functions.  The complete list of primary rights can be found in the
.BR rights (7)
manual page.
.PP
If the
.I fcntls
argument is non-NULL, it will be filled in with a bitmask of allowed
.BR fcntl (2)
commands; see
.BR cap_rights_limit (2)
for values.  If the file descriptor does not have the
.B CAP_FCNTL
primary right, the returned
.I fcntls
value will be zero.
.PP
If the
.I nioctls
argument is non-NULL, it will be filled in with the number of allowed
.BR ioctl (2)
commands, or with the value CAP_IOCTLS_ALL to indicate that all
.BR ioctl (2)
commands are allowed.  If the file descriptor does not have the
.B CAP_IOCTL
primary right, the returned
.I nioctls
value will be zero.
.PP
The
.I ioctls
argument (if non-NULL) should point at memory that can hold up to
.I nioctls
values.
The system call populates the provided buffer with up to
.I nioctls
elements, but always returns the total number of
.BR ioctl (2)
commands allowed for the given file descriptor in
.I nioctls
as described above.
.PP
If all
.BR ioctl (2)
commands are allowed (the
.B CAP_IOCTL
primary capability right is assigned to the file descriptor and the
set of allowed
.BR ioctl (2)
commands was never limited for this file descriptor), the
system call will not modify the buffer pointed to by the
.I ioctls
argument.
.PP
Capsicum capability rights assigned to a file descriptor can be reduced with the
.BR cap_rights_limit (2)
system call.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR cap_rights_get ()
returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
isn't a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Invalid pointer argument.
.SH VERSION
Capsicum support was added to the kernel in version 3.???.
