.TH CAP_RIGHTS_LIMIT 2 2014-05-07 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
cap_rights_limit \- limit Capsicum capability rights
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/capsicum.h>
.sp
.BI "int cap_rights_limit(int " fd ", const struct cap_rights *" rights ,
.BI "                     unsigned int " fcntls ,
.BI "                     int " nioctls ", unsigned int *" ioctls );
.SH DESCRIPTION
When a file descriptor is created by a function such as
.BR accept (2),
.BR accept4 (2),
.BR creat (2),
.BR epoll_create (2),
.BR eventfd (2),
.BR mq_open (2),
.BR open (2),
.BR openat (2),
.BR pdfork (2),
.BR pipe (2),
.BR pipe2 (2),
.BR signalfd (2),
.BR socket (2),
.BR socketpair (2)
or
.BR timerfd_create (2),
it implicitly has all Capsicum capability rights.
Those rights can be reduced (but never expanded) by using the
.BR cap_rights_limit ()
system call.
Once Capsicum capability rights are reduced, operations on the file descriptor
.I fd
will be limited to those permitted by the remainder of the arguments.
.PP
The
.I rights
argument describes the primary rights for the file descriptor, and
should be prepared using
.BR cap_rights_init (3)
family of functions.  The complete list of primary rights can be found in the
.BR rights (7)
manual page.
.PP
If a file descriptor is granted the
.B CAP_FCNTL
primary capability right, some specific
.BR fcntl (2)
commands can be selectively disallowed with the
.I fcntls
argument.  The following flags may be specified in the
.I fcntls
argument for this:
.TP
.B CAP_FCNTL_GETFL
Permit
.B F_GETFL
command.
.TP
.B CAP_FCNTL_SETFL
Permit
.B F_SETFL
command.
.TP
.B CAP_FCNTL_GETOWN
Permit
.B F_GETOWN
command.
.TP
.B CAP_FCNTL_SETOWN
Permit
.B F_SETOWN
command.
.PP
A value of
.B CAP_FCNTL_ALL
for the
.I fcntls
argument leaves the set of allowed
.BR fcntl (2)
commands unchanged.
.PP
However, note that
.BR fcntl (2)
commands that are analogous to other system calls
(such as
.B F_DUPFD
or
.BR F_GETPIPE_SZ )
are not controlled by the
.B CAP_FCNTL
right and so do not have corresponding values in the
.I fcntls
argument.
.PP
If a file descriptor is granted the
.B CAP_IOCTL
capability right, the list of allowed
.BR ioctl (2)
commands can be selectively reduced (but never expanded) using the
.I nioctls
and
.I ioctls
arguments.
The
.I ioctls
argument is an array of
.BR ioctl (2)
command values and the
.I nioctls
argument specifies the number of elements in the array.
.PP
If the
.I nioctls
argument is -1 or 0, the
.I ioctls
argument is ignored, and either all
.BR ioctl (2)
operations or no
.BR ioctl (2)
operations (respectively) will be allowed.
.PP
Capsicum capability rights assigned to a file descriptor can be obtained with the
.BR cap_rights_get (2)
system call.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR cap_rights_limit ()
returns zero on success. On error, -1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
isn't a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid set of rights has been requested in
.IR rights .
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Out of memory.
.TP
.B ENOTCAPABLE
The arguments contain capability rights not present for the given file descriptor (Capsicum
capability rights list can only be reduced, never expanded).
.SH VERSION
Capsicum support was added to the kernel in version 3.???.
